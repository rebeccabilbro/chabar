# Dataset Provenance

## Fields    
- Location: where in israel    
- Name: what the thing is.    
- Citation: what paper it was published in.
- Type: type of remain. I was wondering if stats can tell us how these different types compare in reliability to each other or how close a type is usually to the 'curve.' Most of the analysis I did focused on technical background and methods used on each type, so stats would be interesting supplement.    
- Date_BP: How old it is, but using "Before Present" dating of scientists. Note- 0 is AD1950, when nukes messed up the carbon isotope ratios in the atmosphere. going back in time you count up.    
- Date_error: ± error range of possible dates for the particular thing. e.g. 5 means it could be anywhere up to 5 years before or after.    
- RSL: Relative sea level ± approximation, like a harbour quay (can't be below water, can't be too far above water or ships couldn't unload).    
- RSL_max: An upper limit for sea level (eg the floor of a now submerged house. when built, the sea could have been anywhere lower than it)
- RSL_min: lower limit for sea level (eg a shipwreck; it didn't sink on dry land, but you don't know if it sank in 1m or 10m of water necessarily)
- RSL_error    
- RSL_min_error    
- RSL_max_error    
- ID - unique identifier just in case.    


## Notes
_Any archaeological remain can indicate sea level at time of use in 1 or more possible ways: (btw all vertical measurements are in cm). The plain RSL is more informative than RSL min or RSL max since those two are only constraints; so maybe they'd be weighted differently. Each one of those measurements may or may not have a vertical ± error in cm associated with it. Generated (when possible) by Rootsumsquare of a bunch of sources of measurement error like tides, waves, shaking hands, DGPS geoid, etc:_
